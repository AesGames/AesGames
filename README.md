### Hi there! Im AestheticalZ, AKA Aesthetical.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
An FPS game, FlagPFP, a personal website, and another game.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
Japanese, Vlang, deeper C#, and more.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
Nothing actually, too many languages that I don't know yet. :P

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
SharpCat's Java version (Java's reflection is absolute trash, please help).

- âš¡ Fun fact:
I learnt to code when I was 13.

- ðŸ’¾ Programming languages:
C# (favorite), Java (sort of?), JS (abandoned it), C++, BlitzBasic (kinda)

I really don't know why github chose my first ever github repo for the artic vault stuff, it feels embarassing...
