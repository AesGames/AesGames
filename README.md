### Hi there! Im AestheticalZ, AKA Aesthetical.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
An FPS game, FlagPFP, and another game.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
Japanese, deeper C#, and more.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
Nothing since popular repositories now use soydev languages like TS.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
SharpCat's Java version (Java's reflection is absolute trash, please help).

- âš¡ Fun fact:
I cannot keep my attention focused on a task for more than 1 minute!

- ðŸ’¾ Programming languages:
C# (favorite), Java (sort of?), JS (abandoned it), C++, BlitzBasic (kinda)

I really don't know why github chose my first ever github repo for the artic vault stuff, it feels embarassing af
